# GroupY-ANAC2018
In this project, we design and implement a negotiation agent on GENIUS[1] for multiparty negotiation, which is a multiagent system developed at the University of Delft, The Netherlands. The implementation is made in Java by using GENIUS negotiation environment. The negotiation agent is designed to be used in the “Stacked Alternating Offers Protocol for Multi-Lateral Negotiation (SAOPMN)”.<br />
GroupY Agent is a time based conceder, which makes adjustments according to its minimum accepted utility threshold. You can see the the details from "GroupY Description" PDF.
